Gosha and Timofey found an unusual speed typing trainer and want to master it. The trainer is a 4x4 key field, to which a configuration of numbers and dots appears at each round. Either a dot or a number from 1 to 9 is written on the key. At time t, the player must simultaneously press all the keys on which the number t is written. Gosha and Timofey can press k keys at one time. If all the necessary keys have been pressed at time t, the players receive 1 point. Find the number of points that Gosha and Timofey can earn if they press the keys together.
The first line contains an integer k (1 ≤ k ≤ 5). The following four lines specify the type of simulator - 4 symbols in each line. Each symbol is either a dot or a digit from 1 to 9. Symbols in one line are consecutive and are not separated by spaces.
