The street where Timofey wants to live has a length of n, i.e. it consists of n
identical consecutive plots. On each plot either a house has already been built, or
the plot is empty. Timofey is looking for a place to build his house. He is very sociable
and does not want to live far from other people living on this street.
In order to optimally choose a place for construction, Timofey wants to know the distance to the nearest empty plot for each
plot. (for an empty plot, this value will be zero - the distance to itself)
Your task is to help Timofey calculate the required distances. To do this, you have a
street map. The houses in Timofey's city were numbered in the order in which they were built,
so their numbers on the map are not ordered in any way. Empty plots are marked with zeros.
Input data format:
The first line contains the street length – n. The next line contains n
non-negative integers – house numbers and designations of empty areas on the map
(zeros). It is guaranteed that there is at least one zero in the sequence.
