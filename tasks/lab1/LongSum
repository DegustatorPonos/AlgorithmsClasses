Three lines are fed to the input. The first contains the representation of a long decimal
number (the first operand), the second - the representation of the operation, the + and - lines, the third - the representation of the second operand.
The length of the first and third lines is limited to 1000 characters. The second line
contains exactly one character.
It is required to perform the operation and output the result in decimal representation.

Note: Try to implement the program in such a way that it can be used in the future. In other works of our course there are problems that require long arithmetic.
