The input is a set of numbers in the range from 1 to 20,000, separated by a space. They form a set A. Then comes the separator - the number 0, and the input is a set of numbers B, separated by a space, 0 is a sign of the end of the description of the set (it is not included in the set). It is necessary to output the set AÎ”B - the symmetric difference of the sets A and B in the order of increasing elements. Use a space as a separator. If the set is empty, output 0.
